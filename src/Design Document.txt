This class is exactly as in the previous implementation of Catherine's code with the added difference of DESCRIPTION HERE. We decided to add this difference because

This is a completely new class that we added because

Team: This is a completely new class that we added based off of the original Team object of Catherine's code that is actually the abstract class to MonsterTeam and HeroTeam because we decided that for better encapsulation of the two teams as well as scalability because then should the game ever need more teams of any other type of character, another team can easily be added under Team.
	-MonsterTeam + HeroTeam both are completely new classes added for better encapsulation and inheritance.
